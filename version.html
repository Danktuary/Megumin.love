        <div class="version-box">
            <h2>Version P1 (Prototype 1) -- 03.05.2016</h2>
            <p>First prototype of the website! Featured simple sound and a counter (non-saved).</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="version-box">
            <h2>Version P2 (Prototype 2) -- 15.05.2016</h2>
            <p>Second prototype of the website! Featured more complex sound (multiplay, ..) and a saved counter via PHP/JS.</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="version-box">
            <h2>Version P3 (Prototype 3) -- 24.05.2016</h2>
            <p>The third prototype, woo! Features SQL implementation via PHP, with the help of Kagumi (see credits).</p>
        </div>

        <div class="version-box">
            <h2>Version 1.0 (!) -- 04.06.2016</h2>
            <p>Woohoo, initial release! Features a sidebar with contact info aswell as links to partner sites. Also, counter is now saved in cache (background), while the counter seen on the page is instantly updated. (Meaning that even if cache gets under load, the button will keep up for you personally, and update in the background). This may result in discrepancies if you press the button fast and instantly refresh, but don't worry!</p>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="version-box">
            <h2>Version 1.1 -- 28.06.2016</h2>
            <p>At last, finals are over! This version adds sound randomization for the button, so you'll no longer exclusively hear "yamero", but also various others such as her name intro! (Currently 5 different sounds have been implemented. I am open to add more if I am provided with a theme-fitting crop of the sound in mp3 format.) </p>
        </div>

        <div class="version-box">
            <h2>Version 1.2 -- 05.11.2016</h2>
            <p>Well, I sure haven't done anything in a long time. This update makes the switch from MySQL to SQLite, introduces a whole bunch of new sounds aswell as minor improvements to the CSS and HTML. And a little information: I plan on adding more sounds once Season 2 goes live, so stay tuned for that!</p>
